## ‚≠êFeatures

- Real-time Emotion Detection: The project incorporates a real-time emotion detection model.
- Face Detection: The model utilizes the Haar cascade model to detect faces in real-time camera feeds.
- Emotion Display: Detected emotions are displayed in a square overlay on top of the detected face.
- Emotion Saving: Predictions are saved into a CSV file for further analysis and tracking.

## üåü Datasets & Model Architecture

Our project utilized two different datasets: [FER 2013 from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) and [CKextended]().<br>
We experimented with two different model architectures on each dataset, resulting in four different models in total. <br>
After thorough evaluation, we selected the best-performing model for integration into our web application.
